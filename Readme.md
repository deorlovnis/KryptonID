<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Our mission is to provide secure KYC solutions for crypto, ensuring users, businesses, and governments can achieve the highest level of trust.</em></p>


## Proof-of-Concept

This repository contains a proof-of-concept for connecting government-issued eIDs with blockchains. In this case, it's implemented for the Estonian ID card and Ethereum wallet via a smart contract wallet. This approach ensures that access to the crypto wallet is granted only to the owner of the ID card, allowing users to prove ownership of funds and verify identity.

## Vision

We aim to enable trustless direct relationships between citizens, businesses, and governmental agencies to support the integration of crypto with traditional businesses, prevent financial crimes, and protect end users.

## Warning

This version of the proof-of-concept is untested and not intended for production use. Please do not use it to send or receive funds.
